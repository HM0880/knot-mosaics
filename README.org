#+title:  Knot Mosaics README
#+author: Hannah Miller

* Intro

Encode knot mosaics as a SAT formula and solve with a SAT solver.

Preliminary work is published at [1].


* Files

- [[./encode.py]] : Encode mosaic knots for a SAT solver.

- [[./solve.py]] : Use PySAT bindings [2] to get all solutions of a knot
  mosaic formula.


* Other

As of September 2022, for solving boards larger than 4x4, the best
solver that we have found is Toda's BDD-based ALLSAT solver [3].
