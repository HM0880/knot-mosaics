* Intro

Encode knot mosaics as a SAT formula and solve with a SAT solver.

Preliminary work is published at [1].


* Files

- [[./encode.py]] : Encode knot mosaics as a SAT formula.

- [[./solve.py]] : Get all solutions of a knot mosaic SAT formula with
  PySAT bindings [2,3].


* Other

As of September 2022, for solving boards larger than 4x4, the best
solver that we have found is Toda's BDD-based ALLSAT solver [4].
